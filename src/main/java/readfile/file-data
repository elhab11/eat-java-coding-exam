Despite arriving nearly eight years ago, Java 8 remains the most-used version of Java among
users polled in a recent survey by Perforce Software company. However, many shops have plans
to upgrade to the much newer Java 17, the survey found.

Asked which JDK (Java Development Kit) programming language was being used in their main
application, 37% of respondents in the Perforce-sponsored survey answered Java 8.
The runner-up was Java 11, used by 29% of those surveyed.
The results of the survey of 876 Java development professionals, which took place from
October 2021 to January 2022, were published this week in the 2022 Java Developer
Productivity Report.
